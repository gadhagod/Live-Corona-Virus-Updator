# Live COVID-19 Feed
Get a live update of the number of cases, recoveries, and deaths from the coronavirus. All versions of this program use the code from backend, so make sure to use backend if you want to use any of these versions or other code.

### PyGame Version
This version of the COVID-19 case feed requires pygame. It opens an application window with all the information. You can press space while in the window to change the color scheme. You can install pygame by running these commands in the python command line or terminal:

pip install pygame

or 

pip3 install pygame

### Default Version
This version of the live COVID-19 case feed runs in the python console. It is easier to access, but there are no controls.

### OLED Screen Monitor Version
This version of the live COVID-19 feed runs on a RPI (rasberry pi). It requires an OLED display. This is physical and can be hanged up on a wall or be transported. Tutorial here: https://www.hackster.io/gadhagod/live-coronavirus-stats-display-e07e89.

### GUI Version
This version of the live COVID-19 feed (Graphical User Interface version) is interactable and is similar to the PyGame version. It is still development, but there are still some features you can use. This version requires the PySimpleGUI library to work. You can install it by running these commands in the command line or terminal:

pip install pysimplegui

or

pip3 install pysimplegui
